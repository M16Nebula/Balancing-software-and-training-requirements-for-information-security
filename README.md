Balancing iSSR and iSTR for information security 💻🔐👨🏻‍💻
</h1> 

### Supporting materials used in our experiment. Note that a more detailed description of the research methodology and approach is included in the research paper. This repository contains only the supporting materials used in our research.

The research is published in Computers & Security. Please check here for more informations: 🟢**TODO**🟢

The repository consists of the following file/folder:

### [Readme](README.md) file 📜
Info. about the repository.

### [Materials](Materials) folder 📁

Here you can find the following:

- **Informed_consent.pdf** -> informations to the participants in the experiment. This document contains basic information about the experiment (basic research information such as duration, conditions of participation, ethical approval reference number, etc.).
- **Scenario.pdf** -> the scenario in which participants made their decisions. The scenario includes the problem domain and a description of the research process. In this way, the participants in the experiment knew what they had to do or what role they should take. The problem domain referred to "University X", which wanted to set up a new student information system.
- **data_c_en.pdf** -> data received by the control group (does not include a mapping tool that represents an independent variable). 
- **data_t_en.pdf** -> data received by the experimental group.
- **Dictionary** -> includes explanations about the terms and concepts used in the research for easier understanding of information security functionalities (e.g., replay attack, OAuth, deserialization, ...). The purpose of the dictionary is to ensure a uniform understanding of the terminology, i.e. that the participants in the experiment are not familiar with the terminology used and that they do not have to search the internet for explanations.
  - **dictionarypart1.pdf** -> part 1 of the dictionary. 
  - **dictionarypart2.pdf** -> part 2 of the dictionary. 
- **iSSR_template.pdf** -> template in which participants entered their iSSR decisions. 
- **iSTR_template.pdf** -> template in which participants entered their iSTR decisions. 

**Note**: Both the experimental group (also referred to as the treatment group in the literature) and the control group all received the same documents, except for the data (more precisely; data_c_en. PDF OR data_t_en.PDF). Data_t_en.PDF contains a mapping tool, while data_c_en-PDF does not.
